# Feature Ideas

- Multiple swatches per project, assign swatches per step (tab navigation?)
- Accordion for steps and pattern pieces
- Import/export
- Reuse measurements (e.g. starting measurement of one step is ending measurement of previous step)
- Overall preview of each pattern piece or even of all pattern pieces together
- Bezier curves for side seams etc.
- V-Neck
- Delete and reorder pattern pieces
- Weight of the whole project (need to be able to define how many of each pattern piece will be knitted, like 2 sleeves)
- SVG import??
